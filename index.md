We believe experimentation is key in learning. Project-Based Learning is hard to implement from scratch and hence we aim to provide a starting point for any educator or learner.

The lab introduces the fundamentals of Control Engineering through simulation and rapid controller prototyping with the free Arduino support packages for MATLAB and Simulink: <https://mathworks.com/arduino>. 

A working copy of MATLAB is required. An Arduino board can be acquired at <https://www.arduino.cc>.
