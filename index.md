We believe experimentation is key in learning. Project-Based Learning is hard to implement from scratch and hence we aim to provide a starting point for any educator or learner. DBL is a project to develop freely redistributable materials to conduct educational lab projects with MATLAB, Simulink, Arduino and low-cost plants.

The lab introduces the fundamentals of Control Engineering through simulation and rapid controller prototyping with the free Arduino support packages for MATLAB and Simulink: <https://mathworks.com/arduino>. 

A working copy of MATLAB is required. An Arduino board can be acquired at <https://www.arduino.cc>.

# Projects
The practices of the subject Computer Control consist in the study of a servomechanism of angular positioning (LJ Technical Systems) controlled by a PC. The laboratory sessions P1 and P2 focus on the experimental analysis of the temporal and frequency responses of the system respectively. Session P3 is dedicated to the design of PID controllers.

All the projects can be seen on [projects](projects.md) and all the material can be downloaded in the three languages on [download](download.md). In this last section, you will find the MATLAB/Simulink files and other interesting documents as the gerbers used to create an Arduino Due shield and an explanation of how the signal adapter has been created.
