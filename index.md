# Duino-Based Learning (DBL)
A project to develop freely redistributable materials to conduct educational lab projects with MATLAB, Simulink, Arduino and low-cost setups.

We believe experimentation is key in learning. Project-Based Learning is hard to implement from scratch and hence we aim to provide a starting point for any educator or learner.

The lab introduces the fundamentals of Control Engineering Fundamentals through simulation and rapid controller prototyping based on the free Arduino support packages for MATLAB and Simulink: https://mathworks.com/arduino

# Scope
- Build instructions for all the setups
- MATLAB live scripts with exercises
- Simulink models
- Walk-through videos

# Languages
- English
- Spanish
- Catalan

# Downloadble materials
A first draft is available at https://github.com/DuinoBasedLearning/Lab
